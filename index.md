## Me

I'm a tinkerer by nature since I was little. It ended up evolving into software development as a profession, kind of a branch of tinkering if you ask me (information tinkerer?).

Studied computer science, specialized in computer vision and machine learning with a Master's degree. I worked a bit with autonomous cars and now I work developing software
for industrial simulations. I love the sea, the beach, nature and (yet again) tinkering.
