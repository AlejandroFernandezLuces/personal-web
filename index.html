<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>Research &amp; Development Engineer at Ansys, where I’m developing
PyAnsys open source initiative. I loved the machine learning and
computer vision subjects, so I decided to specialize on it with a
master’s degree. Passionate about all science.</p>
<h1 id="skills-overview">Skills overview</h1>
<h2 id="software-engineering">Software engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>I mostly program in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>C++</strong>
(3 years work experience), and some <strong>Golang</strong>. I’m
experienced in <strong>object oriented programming</strong>, so I’m
comfortable in any language that uses this paradigm. I’ve implemented
plenty of REST services, using OpenAPI for the specification, Flask
framework in Python, and Boost in C++.</li>
<li>I’ve continuously been using <strong>Git</strong> since the start of
my career, with Github and Gitlab, to organize and maintain my code, and
to properly collaborate with others. I’ve implemented <strong>Github
Workflows</strong> for the continous integration and continuous delivery
of my projects, as well as some open source <strong>Github
Actions</strong>. Also, I’ve worked plenty with <strong>Docker</strong>
to containerize my applications for easier deployment.</li>
<li>To sustain code quality in the projects I participate in, I use
extensive code testing, through <strong>PyTest</strong> and
<strong>Google test</strong> frameworks. Also I participate in
<strong>code reviews</strong> to ensure code quality, both as reviewer
and reviewee. ## Machine Learning and computer vision</li>
<li>I’m working on several language processing projects, where I use
<strong>OpenAI Azure</strong>, <strong>Ollama</strong> and
<strong>HuggingFace</strong>, for RAG based applications for coding
helpers.</li>
<li>I’ve worked with <strong>OpenCV</strong> and different <strong>deep
learning</strong> approaches for <strong>real time object detection and
classification</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Monospace fonts are dear to many of us. Some find them more readable,
consistent, and beautiful, than their proportional alternatives. Maybe
we’re just brainwashed from spending years in terminals? Or are we
hopelessly nostalgic? I’m not sure. But I like them, and that’s why I
started experimenting with all-monospace Web.</p>
<p>On this page, I use a monospace grid to align text and draw diagrams.
It’s generated from a simple Markdown document (using Pandoc), and the
CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript renders it on the grid. The page is
responsive, shrinking in character-sized steps. Standard elements should
<em>just work</em>, at least that’s the goal. It’s semantic HTML,
rendered as if we were back in the 70s.</p>
<p>All right, but is this even a good idea? It’s a technical and
creative challenge and I like the aestethic. If you’d like to use it,
feel free to fork or copy the bits you need, respecting the license. I
might update it over time with improvements and support for more
standard elements.</p>
<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
<p>This document uses a few extra classes here and there, but mostly
it’s just markup. This, for instance, is a regular paragraph.</p>
<p>Look at this horizontal break:</p>
<hr>
<p>Lovely. We can hide stuff in the <code>&lt;details</code>&gt;
element:</p>
<details>
<summary>
A short summary of the contents
</summary>
<p>
Hidden gems.
</p>
</details>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>This is a plain old bulleted list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Paper boat</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
<li>Rocket</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordered lists look pretty much as you’d expect:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Motivations
<ol type="1">
<li>Intrinsic</li>
<li>Extrinsic</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Second-order effects</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s nice to visualize trees. This is a regular unordered list with a
<code>tree</code> class:</p>
<ul class="tree">

<p>Here are some buttons:</p>

name <input type="text" placeholder="Text goes here..." /></label>
<label>Age <input type="text" value="30" /></label>
</form>
<h2 id="grids">Grids</h2>
<p>Add the <code>grid</code> class to a container to divide up the
horizontal space evenly for the cells. Note that it maintains the
monospace, so the total width might not be 100%. Here are six grids with
increasing cell count:</p>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" />
</div>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" />
</div>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" />
</div>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" />
</div>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" />
</div>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" /><input readonly value="6" />
</div>
<p>If we want one cell to fill the remainder, we set
<code>flex-grow: 1;</code> for that particular cell.</p>
<div class="grid">
<input readonly value="1" /><input readonly value="2" /><input readonly value="3!" style="flex-grow: 1;" /><input readonly value="4" /><input readonly value="5" /><input readonly value="6" />
</div>
<h2 id="ascii-drawings">ASCII Drawings</h2>
<p>We can draw in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters">box-drawing
characters</a>:</p>
<pre><code>╭─────────────────╮
│ MONOSPACE ROCKS │
╰─────────────────╯</code></pre>
<p>To have it stand out a bit more, we can wrap it in a
<code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag, and why not also add a
<code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>.</p>
